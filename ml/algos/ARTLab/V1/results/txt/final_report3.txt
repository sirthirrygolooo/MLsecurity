=== Adversarial Robustness Experiment Report ===

Key Findings:
- The model's accuracy drops from 78.31% to 42.40% under FGSM attack (45.86% reduction)
- Under more sophisticated PGD attack, accuracy drops further to 25.22%
- Adversarial training improves robustness, reducing FGSM effectiveness by 84.52%
- The trade-off is a 52.61% increase in training time

Recommendations:
1. Implement adversarial training for critical applications
2. Monitor inference times for potential attack detection
3. Combine adversarial training with other defenses like input sanitization
4. Consider model distillation to reduce computational overhead
